Double click the .bat script. This will copy the "ReaCoMa 2.0" folder to %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\REAPER\Scripts (the REAPAER resource path).

Next, you must install ReaImGui (https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=250419) a library that displays graphics for controlling the scripts. You can install this two ways:

1. Through ReaPack (https://reapack.com/)
2. Manually (https://github.com/ReaCoMa/ReaCoMa-2.0/wiki/installation#step-2-install-reaimgui)

You can read a guide on how to do this here: https://github.com/ReaCoMa/ReaCoMa-2.0/wiki/installation#step-2-install-reaimgui
